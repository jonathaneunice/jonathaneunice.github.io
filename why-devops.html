            <h1 class="title">Why Do DevOps?</h1>
            <p>
                <img src="devops.png" style="width: 3in; float: right;">Because DevOps is a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_multiplication">force multiplier</a>.
                It provides the historic opportunity to connect all phases of
                IT, from the aspirations of businesses to the imagination of
                designers and architects through the code artistry of developers
                and the meticulous monitoring and care of production services.
                Forget &ldquo;full stack&rdquo;; DevOps embraces the
                <i>complete</i> stack and all the processes that surround it.
                Even more important, DevOps gives the power and levers to
                &ldquo;improve the way things are done.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>
                To be sure, it also includes all the frustration that attend
                &ldquo;mechanic work&rdquo; and quite a lot of &ldquo;herding
                cats.&rdquo; Invariably-recalcitrant people, processes, cultural
                expectations, and tools must be made to play nicely together. There
                are silos to be worked around, historical band-aids to be improved,
                and constant time pressure. You get blamed for everything that
                doesn&rsquo;t work, no matter who picked it, wrote it, owns it, or
                currently runs it&mdash;regardless of how long it&rsquo;s been a
                problem.</p>

            <h2 class="header">&ldquo;Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?&rdquo;</h2>
            <p>
                I admire, take solace from the travails of, and learn from other difficult fields such as
                fire-fighting, motion picture production, and America&rsquo;s get-to-the-moon program.
                When there are dozens or hundreds of problems ahead of you every day, nothing suffices but
                getting into the fight. Fight high and low, strategic and tactical,
                left and right. Focus on *this* problem right in front of you the next hour, then when that&rsquo;s
                tamped down, move on to the next dozen things that needed fixed two weeks, months, or years ago.
                And keep enough in the tank to fight the long-term, systemic problems that no one else has imagined
                can yet be fixed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The frustrations of the job are real. That notwithstanding,
                DevOps epitomizes the power of integration, networked resources,
                and a positive opportunity to make things right. Even the
                gnarliest knots can be untied, if you&lsquo;re systematic and
                relentless. That constant challenge is matched by the constant
                opportunity to fix, to improve, to create leverage.
            </p>
            <p>&ldquo;Once more unto the breach, dear friends! Once more!&rdquo;</p>

            <h2 class="header">Isn&rsquo;t DevOps Just Glorified Systems Administration?</h2>

            <p>Uh&hellip;no. No, no, <b>no</b>! If that's how you&rsquo;re doing DevOps,
               you&rsquo;re doing it very, very, <i>OMG! so very wrong.</i></p>
            <p>The whole point is getting out of the reactive, repetitive, labor-intensive work of IT-that-was. To convert
                skills into processes, automate gratuitous labor out of the equation, and bridge
                the former chasm between software and systems, between dev and ops.
                The tools we use&mdash;the containers
                and clouds, the VMs and CI/CD pipelines, the monitoring and the orchestration engines&mdash;they&rsquo;re
                often talked about as through they are core of DevOps. They are not. They are
                simply the practical means to achieve integration goals.
                If you must make DevOps about a thing, that thing
                should be the evolving of infrastructure <i>and</i> processes
                into software,
                so that code, instrumentation, monitoring, and alerting
                can stand in for what was once repetitive human labor and constant
                attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                There <i>is</i> a lot of mechanic work involved. There are also
                a lot of incidents to field and debug, making you
                first-responder and trauma team through rehab specialist. But
                you&rsquo;d better be a developer at heart, to build better
                structures. A bit of a data scientist, to understand the
                indicators and trends. And an architect, to design features and
                processes that work at scale. And at least a semi-advanced cat
                wrangler, to get all the disparate people and groups aligned
                behind the way things should be done. And, and, and&hellip;
            </p>
            <p>
                It&rsquo;s holistic, challenging, and requires polymaths. Anyone
                who feels right and justified reducing DevOps to fancified,
                shmancified sysadmin work&mdash;that&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s
                only seen it done poorly.
