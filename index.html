            <h2>Every Superhero Needs an Origin Story</h2>

            <p>I have one too.</p>

            <p>I've been in IT for a while.
            Thought I was going
            to be an academic computer scientist. Surprise!</p>
            <blockquote>
            &ldquo;Life is what happens to you while you are busy making other plans.&rdquo;

              <p>
            Got yanked out of the academic
            career path
            into "Wall Street" to apply computing expertise and
            analytic skills to evaluating "hot" emerging technologies, companies, trends,
            and business opportunities.</p>
            <p>
            Made investors money and moved markets. Participated in IPOs and
            witnessed the birth of the first real "quant"
            investing.</p>
            <p>
            Most of all, learned the things that really
            drive human and organizational change.
            Not "better mousetraps," but better opportunities.

            Within a few years, my firm shifted from financial to
            industrial clients to capture the "client/server" wave&mdash;the epic
            rise of
            networked PCs, Unix workstations and servers, Windows,
            distributed
            computing, RISC CPUs, clustered HPTC, "open standards," COTS,
            data warehousing and VLDB.
            I tracked right into the second
            wave with the internet, Java, the world-wide web, e-business, and birth of open source.
            Then the third wave with scale-out computing, Big Iron Unix, grid, SOA,
            web services, and start of programmable, reconfigurable infrastructure
            as software.
            Then the fourth wave with everything web, agile, virtualization,
            dynamic languages, modular servers,
            a data center and power/energy revolution, cloud, deep computing, "big data"
            and analytics,
            rich internet apps, widespread data integration, and the
            end of IT as a box business. I've eagerly tracked right into
            the fifth wave, with mobile ascendent, everything-as-a-service,
            agile DevOps as law,
            the normalization of continuously integrated and delivered apps
            and network businesses,
            pervasive broadband, the rise of JavaScript and node.js,
            and the breakout of data science and machine learning.
            Even so, I've left out the half of it.
            </p>
            <p>

            Whatever happened in the networked computing revolution, I was
            there on the front lines, as or before it went mainstream.
            Served as analyst and advisor at the highest levels
            possible.  Consulted and retained by many of the world's
            largest IT developers, investors, and consumers.  Called upon by
            business executives, corporate teams, government agencies,
            distinguished engineers and research fellows alike. I traveled the world,
            keynoted
            events, guided major company and
            development initiatives, was widely quoted by the
            tech and business press,
            sparked mergers and acquisitions,
            helped answer questions in times of chaos and transition,
            and served as expert in epic
            legal and procurement disputes.

              <p>

            Phenomenal as my advisory career was, I still
            wanted to be <i>*more*</i> involved.
            Being an analyst and consultant brings you into
            exciting projects, efforts, and situations&mdash;often
            at the highest levels, and in their pivotal moments. But however
            key your insights and guidance, however much you
            get to structure the plan, choose the tools,
            or figure out how to rescue
            a bad situation,
            there's limited opportunity for "skin in the game."
            Engagements are transitory. You help a team choose or
            correct
            its path, but they're the ones that get to "run the
            play."
              </p>
              <p>
                By 2010, I had "done it all." I could continue acing that course
            for another thirty-something years, but as an analyst and consultant,
            there's nothing
            left to prove. No more mountains to climb. What's the
            fun in doing the same-ol&rsquo;, same-&rsquo;? Time for a new horizon.

            In 2011, I fundamentally refocused on building apps and operating services.
            Had actually never stopped building things,
            having worked on significant internal IT projects
            and open source
            contributions all along. But
            hands-on became my primary responsibility.
            Python, JavaScript, repos, cloud instances,
            and DevOps
            became my workaday companions. Stack Overflow
            and code deep-dives became my constant reading.
            Still work with SVPs and CTOs, but my clients have greatly
            diversified into everyday developers, operators, app owners,
            domain specialists,
            and students. I've rekindled my enthusiasm for
            mentoring, especially through
