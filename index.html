            <h1>Seeking Next Opportunity</h1>
            <p>I've enjoyed the independent, on-call gig. It&rsquo;s let me jump into
                many interesting situations, often at the most exiting point: their time of
                greatest chaos and need. But engagements are transient in the
                same way as my analyst and consulting career.
                I&rsquo;m now looking for a longer-term opportunity
                where I can consistently grow, improve, and advance
                one team.

                <div id="two" class="collapse">
                    <p>Within a few years, my firm shifted from financial to
                    industrial clients to capture the epic rise of networked
                    computing. It started with <span class="circlenum">①</span>
                    networked PCs, client/server apps, Unix workstations and
                    servers, Windows, distributed computing, RISC CPUs, clustered
                    HPTC, “open standards,” COTS replacing bespoke, data warehousing
                    and VLDB. I tracked right into <span class="circlenum">②</span>
                    the internet, Java, the world-wide web, e-business, x86 remade,
                    and the birth of open source. Then <span class=
                    "circlenum">③</span> scale-out computing, Big Iron Unix, grid,
                    SOA, web services, and the start of programmable “infrastructure
                    as software.” Then <span class="circlenum">④</span> everything
                    web, agile, virtualization, dynamic languages, modular servers,
                    a data center and power/energy revolution, cloud, deep
                    computing, “big data” and analytics, rich internet apps,
                    widespread data integration, and the end of IT as a box
                    business. I’ve eagerly tracked right into <span class=
                    "circlenum">⑤</span> mobile ascendent, everything-as-a-service,
                    agile DevOps as law, the normalization of continuously
                    integrated and delivered apps and network businesses, pervasive
                    broadband, the rise of JavaScript and node.js, and the breakout
                    of data science and machine learning. Even so, I’ve left out the
                    half of it, and remain eager for <span class=
                    "circlenum">⑥</span> what comes next.</p>

                    <p>Whatever happened in the networked computing revolution, I
                    was there on the front lines, as or before it went mainstream.
                    Served as analyst and advisor at the highest levels possible.
                    Consulted and retained by many of the world’s largest IT
                    developers, investors, and consumers. Called upon by business
                    executives, corporate teams, government agencies, distinguished
                    engineers and research fellows alike. I traveled the world,
                    keynoted events, guided major company and development
                    initiatives, was widely quoted by the tech and business press,
                    sparked mergers and acquisitions, helped answer questions in
                    times of chaos and transition, and served as expert in epic
                    legal and procurement disputes.</p>

                    data-target="#three">End of the Era</button></p>

                <div id="three" class="collapse">
                    <p>Phenomenal as my advisory career was, I still wanted to be
                    <i>*more*</i> involved. Being an analyst and consultant brings
                    you into exciting projects, efforts, and situations—often at the
                    highest levels, and in their pivotal moments. But however key
                    your insights and guidance, however much you get to structure
                    the plan, choose the tools, or figure out how to rescue a bad
                    situation, there’s limited opportunity for “skin in the game.”
                    Engagements are transitory. You help a team choose or correct
                    its path, but they’re the ones that get to “run the play.”</p>

                    <p>By 2010, I had “done it all.” I could continue acing that
                    course for another thirty-something years, but as an analyst and
                    consultant, there’s nothing left to prove. No more mountains to
                    climb. What’s the fun in doing the same-ol’, same-ol’? Time for
                    a new horizon.</p>

                <div id="four" class="collapse">
                    <p>In 2011, I fundamentally refocused on building apps and
                    operating services. Had actually never stopped building
                    things, having worked on significant internal IT projects
                    and open source contributions all along. But hands-on became
                    my primary responsibility. Python, JavaScript, repos, cloud
                    instances, and DevOps became my workaday companions. Stack
                    Overflow and code deep-dives became my constant reading.
                    Still work with SVPs and CTOs, but my clients have greatly
                    diversified into everyday developers, operators, app owners,
                    domain specialists, and students. I’ve rekindled my
