            <h2>Why DevOps?</h2>
            <p><img src="devops.png" style="width: 3in; float: right;">DevOps is a force-multiplier. It provides the historic opportunity to connect all phases
                of IT, from the imagination of designers and architects through the meticulous monitoring
                and care of production services&mdash;in other words, the power and
                levers to &ldquo;improve the way things are done.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>It also includes all the frustration of &ldquo;mechanic work&rdquo; and quite a lot of
                &ldquo;herding cats&rdquo;.
                Invariably-recalcitrant people, processes, cultural expectations, and tools have be brought 
                together and made to work together.
                There are often silos to be worked around, 
                ugly prior band-aids to be improved, and constant time pressure.
                You get blamed for everything that doesn&rsquo;t work, no matter who picked it, wrote it,
                owns it, or currently runs it&mdash;no matter how long it&rsquo;s been a problem.
            </p>
            <h2>&ldquo;Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?&rdquo;</h2>
            <p>
                I admire, take solace from the travails of, and learn from other difficult fields such as
                fire-fighting, motion picture production, and America&rsquo;s get-to-the-moon program.
                When there are dozens or hundreds of problems ahead of you every day, nothing suffices but
                getting into the fight. Fight high and low, strategic and tactical,
                left and right. Focus on *this* problem right in front of you the next hour, then when that&rsquo;s
                tamped down, move on to the next dozen things that needed fixed two weeks, months, or years ago.
                And keep enough in the tank to fight the long-term, systemic problems that no one else has imagined
                can yet be fixed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Frustrations notwithstanding, DevOps is a wonderful field that epitomizes the power of
                integration, networked resources, and a positive opportunity to make things right.
                Even the largest knots can be untied, if you're systematic and relentless. That constant
                challenge is matched by the constant opportunity to fix, to improve, to create leverage.
            </p>
            <p>&ldquo;Once more unto the breach, dear friends! Once more!&rdquo;</p>

            <h2>Isn&rsquo;t DevOps Just Glorified Systems Administration?</h2>

            <p>Uh&hellip;no. No, no, <b>no</b>! If that's how you&rsquo;re doing DevOps,
               you&rsquo;re doing it very, very, <i>OMG! so very wrong.</i></p>
            <p>The whole point is getting out of the reactive, repetitive, labor-intensive work of IT-that-was. To convert
                skills into processes, to automate gratuitous labor out of the equation, and to bridge
                the former chasm between software and systems, between dev and ops. The tools we use&mdash;the containers
                and clouds, the VMs and CI/CD pipelines, the monitoring and the orchestration engines&mdash;they&rsquo;re
                just means to this integrated end.
                If you must make it about a thing, that thing
                should be the evolving of infrastructure <i>and</i> processes
                into software,
                so that code, instrumentation, monitoring, and alerting
                can stand in for what was once repetitive human labor and constant
                attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                There <i>is</i> a lot of mechanic work involved. There are also a lot of incidents to field
                and debug, making you first-responder and trauma team through rehab specialist.
                But you&rsquo;d better be a developer at heart, to build better structures. A bit of a
                data scientist, to understand the indicators and
                trends. And an architect, to design features and processes that
                work at scale. And at least a semi-advanced cat wrangler, to
                get all the disparate people and groups aligned behind the way
                things should be done. And, and, and&hellip;
            </p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s holistic, challenging, and requires polymaths. Anyone who feels right and justified reducing
                DevOps to fancified, shmancified sysadmin work&mdash;that&rsquo;s a
                person who&rsquo;s only seen it done poorly.</p>
